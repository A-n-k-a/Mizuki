# Crafting Seamless User Experiences: A Journey through User Classes, Requirement Analysis, Prototyping, and Usability Testing in HCI
## Scenario: "E-Commerce Platform Redesign"
**Objective:** In this scenario, you will collaborate to redesign an existing e-commerce platform, focusing on user classes, user requirement analysis, design (prototyping), and usability testing.
## Activity Breakdown:
### User Classes Identification:
- Divide into small groups.
- Each group identifies different user classes for the e-commerce platform (e.g.,buyers, sellers, administrators).
- Groups discuss and document each user class's characteristics, goals, and needs.
### User Requirement Analysis:
- Groups perform user interviews (simulated or real) to gather specific requirements from representatives of each identified user class.
- Students analyze the gathered data to create a list of user requirements and prioritize them based on importance.
### Prototyping:
- Using tools like Figma, Pencil Project, Sketch, Computer-based or paper and pen, students design a low-fidelity prototype (Download the Balsamic or Pencil project) of the redesigned e-commerce platform.
- Emphasize the importance of incorporating the identified user requirements into the prototype design.
### Usability Testing:
- Groups exchange prototypes and conduct usability testing sessions within their teams using <u><strong><span style="color:red">SUS usability Scale</span></strong></u>
- Each group provides feedback to the other on the usability and user experience of the prototype.
- Discuss common usability issues and potential improvements.
### Conclusion and Discussion:
- Each group presents its redesigned prototype to the class, explaining its design choices and how it addressed user requirements.
- Facilitate a class discussion on the challenges, lessons learned, and insights gained during the activity.
