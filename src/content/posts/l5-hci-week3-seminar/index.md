# Practicing Task Analysis and User Object Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
## Exercise 1: Task Analysis
**Objective:**  
This activity aims to perform a basic task analysis for a specific task (e.g., booking a flight on an airline website) and create an HTA List and HTA Diagram.  
**Steps to Complete the Exercise:**  
1. **Form small groups** of 3-4 students to work together.
2. **Guiding Questions for Task Analysis**
To help structure the analysis, groups should discuss and answer the following questions:
3. **What are the goals of the user?**
    - Identify the user's primary goal (e.g., booking a flight successfully).
    - Consider any secondary goals (e.g., choosing the best flight option, saving time).
4. **What are the steps involved in completing the task?**
    - Break down the process into smaller actions. Think of the logical flow from start to finish.
    - Start by opening the website and following the steps to confirm **the booking**.
5. **Are there any possible errors or confusion users might face?**
    - Identify potential points where the user could make mistakes (e.g., entering invalid dates, not finding a flight, or missing required information).
    - Think about ways the system could help users avoid these issues (e.g., clear error messages and step-by-step guidance).
6. **Create the HTA List**
    - Based on the discussion, **list all the tasks and subtasks** involved in booking a flight.
7. **Design the HTA Diagram**
    - Use the HTA List to create a **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) Diagram** that visually represents the steps and subtasks.
        - Draw a diagram where the **main tasks** are broken down into smaller subtasks.
        - Show the **logical flow** of actions required to complete the task.

## Exercise 2: User Object Modeling
**Objective:**  
In this exercise, students will develop a **User Object Model** based on the task analysis they performed for **booking a flight on an airline website**. This will help them map user interactions with the interface objects and visualize how these objects change state during the process.  
**Steps to Complete the Exercise:**
1. **Review Your Task Analysis (HTA List and Diagram)**
Before starting the User Object Modeling, students should:  
    - Refer to the **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) List and HTA Diagram** they created to book a flight.
    - Identify the key user actions and decision points from the HTA.
2. **Identify Key User Interface Objects**
From the task analysis, identify the main objects the user interacts with on the airline website.  
3. **Define Object States and Interactions**
Identify each key object's possible states and how it interacts with the user.  
4. **Create the User Object Model Diagram**
Using the identified objects and states, students should create a diagram that illustrates how these objects interact during the flight booking process.
