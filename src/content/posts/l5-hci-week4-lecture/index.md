#### 1. Low-Fidelity Prototypes (Lo-Fi)
These are <span style="color:red">simple, rough representations</span> of a design concept. They help in exploring ideas quickly without focusing on visuals or details.  
<span style="color:blue">Examples:</span>
- **Paper sketches or wireframes**
<span style="color:blue">Purpose:</span>
- Visualize structure and layout
- Explore multiple ideas quickly
- Gather early feedback on flow and usability
- Quick and cheap
- Saves implementation time

#### 2. Mid-Fidelity Prototypes
These add <span style="color:red">more detail and structure</span> than low-fidelity ones but are still <span style="color:red">not fully polished</span>.  
<span style="color:blue">Characteristics:</span>
- Basic UI elements (buttons, menus, icons)
- Partial content and limited colors
- Some interactivity (clickable navigation)
<span style="color:blue">Tools:</span>
- Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Axure
<span style="color:blue">Purpose:</span>
- Refine navigation flow
- Test functionality and layout clarity
- Communicate design direction to stakeholders

## The Guide Method
![](Pasted_image_20251021082923.png)

## Guidelines for interface design
<span style="color:red">ways to present general interface design guidelines</span>  

**General guidelines for interface design** is a crucial part of communicating standards that ensure usability, consistency, and accessibility across digital products.

## General guidelines for interface design
1. <span style="color:red">Design Principles Document</span>
This is a **written set of high-level rules** that guide design decisions across projects.
2. <span style="color:red">Design System / Style Guide</span>
A **design system** or **style guide** is a comprehensive visual and functional library that defines how UI elements should look and behave.
3. <span style="color:red">Heuristic Checklists</span>
Heuristic checklists are **evaluation tools** based on established usability principles (like Nielsen‚Äôs 10 heuristics
4. <span style="color:red">Storyboards and Personas</span>
These **visual storytelling tools** communicate design guidelines through user scenarios.
5. <span style="color:red">Interactive Prototypes and Demonstrations</span>
Instead of static documents, guidelines can be **shown in action** through prototypes.
6. <span style="color:red">Training Workshops and Presentations</span>
Sometimes, guidelines are best introduced through **live sessions** or **team workshops**.

There are several ways of presenting general guidelines  for interface design. We will have a look at two:  
<center>Shneiderman's Guidelines (Shneiderman, 1999)<br>Microsoft Windows Style Guidelines.</center>

### Shneiderman's Guidelines
Ben Shneiderman, a leading expert in (HCI), developed a set of principles to guide designers in creating user-friendly, efficient, and error-tolerant interfaces.  
**key principles-** form the foundation for effective interface design
- *Know Thy User,* 
- *Follow the Eight Golden Rules,*
- *Prevent Errors*

#### Principle 1: ‚ÄúKnow Thy User‚Äù
- Designers must have a **deep understanding of their users** ‚Äî their goals, abilities, limitations, preferences, and working environments. Knowing your user helps ensure the system is intuitive, accessible, and aligned with real user needs.
- <span style="color:blue">Conduct user research</span> (interviews, surveys, observations).
- <span style="color:blue">Create user personas</span> and user journey maps to understand motivations and pain points.
- <span style="color:blue">Design with empathy</span> ‚Äî consider different user skill levels, including beginners, intermediates, and experts.
- <span style="color:blue">Provide customization or flexibility</span> (e.g., shortcut keys for expert users, guided tutorials for novices).

#### Principle 2: Follow the Eight Golden Rules
Classic set of usability heuristics that guide the structure and behavior of interactive systems.
1. **Strive for consistency**
Use consistent terminology, layout, colors, and behavior throughout the interface.
2. **Enable frequent users to use shortcuts**
Allow experienced users to work faster with keyboard shortcuts or command customization.
3. **Offer informative feedback**
The system should always keep users informed about what‚Äôs going on (e.g., ‚ÄúFile uploaded successfully‚Äù).
4. **Design dialogs to yield closure**
Organize interactions into clear sequences with a beginning, middle, and end (e.g., confirmation messages after completing a task).
5. **Offer simple error handling**
Design the interface to prevent errors when possible and provide clear instructions to recover when they occur.
6. **Permit easy reversal of actions**
Support undo, redo, or back functions so users can explore without fear.
7. **Support internal locus of control**
Let users feel in control of the system ‚Äî avoid unexpected actions or interruptions.
8. **Reduce short-term memory load**
Keep information visible and minimize the need to remember data between screens or steps.

#### Principle 3: Prevent Errors
A well-designed interface should **minimize the possibility of user errors** and help users **recover gracefully** if mistakes occur. Error prevention is more effective than error correction.  
**Application in UX/UI Design:**
- Use **constraints** to prevent invalid inputs (e.g., date pickers, drop-down lists).
- Provide **real-time validation** (e.g., ‚ÄúPassword must include at least 8 characters‚Äù).
- Use **confirmation dialogs** for critical actions (e.g., deleting files).
- Highlight potential mistakes before they happen (e.g., warning icons or tooltips).
- Design **clear error messages** that explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Microsoft Windows Style Guidelines
- **Clarity and Affordance**
Buttons and interactive elements should clearly appear clickable or tappable.
- **Navigation**
Use a clear, consistent, and easy-to-follow menu structure.
- **Commands and Actions**
Label buttons with clear action verbs (e.g., Save, Submit, Cancel).
- **Layout and Alignment**
Align icons, buttons, and text to maintain a clean, balanced interface.
- **Typography**
Use legible fonts (e.g., Arial, Segoe UI) for comfortable on-screen reading.
- **Color and Contrast**
Apply colors purposefully
- **Feedback**
Provide clear responses to user actions (e.g., confirmation after submitting a form).
- **Responsiveness**
Ensure quick and smooth reactions to user inputs without noticeable delay.
- **Accessibility**
Design interfaces usable by all, including users with disabilities

## Application Style Guide
- An <span style="color:blue"><strong>application style guide</strong></span> is a set of rules that defines how a user interface (UI) should look and behave. It helps ensure that all parts of an application have a <span style="color:blue"><strong>consistent design and user experience</strong></span>.
    - Defines a standard interface style
    - Focuses on the surface (appearance)
    - Creates a uniform ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù
        - <span style="color:blue">‚ÄúLook‚Äù means the visual appearance ‚Äî colors, typography, and layout.</span>
        - <span style="color:blue">‚ÄúFeel‚Äù means how users interact with it ‚Äî the behavior when clicking buttons, navigating menus, or getting feedback.</span>

### Application style guide: benefits
A more consistent user interface
- <span style="color:red">Increased user productivity</span>, because a consistent style reduces what users need to learn and remember, resulting, <span style="color:red">in shorter training time</span> and <span style="color:red">fewer user errors</span>.
- Reduction in the huge range of choices offered to GUI designers in color, font sizes and styles, window controls, etc.
- <span style="color:red">Increased developer productivity</span>, because developers are applying and specializing standard formats rather than re-inventing new ones.
- <span style="color:red">Enhances collaboration among team members</span>. Designers, developers, and other stakeholders can refer to the style guide
- <span style="color:red">Facilitates rapid/fast prototyping</span> and wire framing

## Problems with the Design of Interfaces
<span style="color:blue"><strong>Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation</strong></span>  
When a user is trying to carry out tasks using an interface, there are two very common types of problem they can encounter:  
<span style="color:red"><i>gaps in the interaction between users and systems</i></span>  

<span style="color:blue">Gulf of Execution</span> refers to the gap between a user‚Äôs intentions (what they want to do) and the actions available to them in the system (what they can actually do).  
**Example:** Imagine a user wants to print a document but struggles to find the "Print‚Äú button in a new software interface.  

<span style="color:blue">Gulf of Evaluation</span> refers to the gap between the system‚Äôs response and the user‚Äôs ability to interpret that response to determine whether their action was successful."  
**Example:** Suppose the user clicks "Print" on a document. After clicking, nothing seems to happen, and there's no feedback from the system  

## Reducing the Gulfs
To reduce the gulfs, provide:
- Visibility (affordances)
- Feedback
- Consistency
- Non-destructive operations
- Discoverability
- Reliability

## Usability
<video src="/l5-hci-week4-lecture-assets/YTDown.com_YouTube_User-Experience-Design-What-is-Usability_Media_UnaxPVbBYiE_001_720p.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls="controls" preload="meta"></video>

**Usability** refers to how easy and effective it is for users to interact with a system, product, or service. Usability measures how well a system supports users in achieving their goals with efficiency, satisfaction, and minimal errors.

### Examples of usability questions
- Will the design of this ATM prevent people from leaving their bank cards behind?
- Is this button on the screen too small to press accurately? 
- And if the user accidentally presses the button, will he/she manage to undo the effects?  
![](Pasted_image_20251021090304.png)

### General Categories of Usability
See Redmond-Pyle & Moore, Section 1.2: 
- <span style="color:blue"><i>Effectiveness:</i></span> 
    - How effectively and/or quickly can the users perform their tasks using the interface? 
- <span style="color:blue"><i>Learnability:</i></span> 
    - How much training time and practice do users require to be effective with the system?
    - If users only use the system intermittently, how long does it take to relearn the system each time they use it?  
- <span style="color:blue"><i>Flexibility:</i></span> 
    - Is the interface still effective if there are changes in the task or environment?
- <span style="color:blue"><i>Attitude/Satisfaction:</i></span> 
    - Do people experience using the system as frustrating, or rewarding?
    - Do users like the system?  

### The need to measure usability
We need to be able to measure usability, to get feedback about our designs (and thus improve them) (Dumas & Redish p184).  
a lot of valuable information can be gained, which can improve a design greatly. This is the whole point of measuring usability.

### Measuring Usability
- Useful terminology: 
    - A measurement is <span style="color:blue"><i>formative</i></span> if it gives back information that provides input into a design (helps form the design)
    - A measurement method is <span style="color:blue"><i>summative</i></span> if it gives information about whether a design meets a standard or not, with no feedback into the design

#### Usability Measuring Methods
According to Preece, there are **two main types of evaluation methods** used in design: **theoretical** and **practical**.
1. <span style="color:red">Analysis (Theoretical Method)</span>
- This method focuses on **thinking and reasoning** about how users will interact with the design, not actually building or testing it.
- You create a **model of the user‚Äôs activities** (how they would use the system), and then you **analyze** that model to predict problems or improvements.
- It doesn‚Äôt require a working prototype or implementation, just a detailed description of the design.
- It‚Äôs **low-cost** and can be done early in the design process.
- It also needs **very little advance planning** compared to real user testing.
2. <span style="color:red">Evaluation (Practical Method)</span>
- In this method, the design must be **built or implemented**, at least as a **prototype** (a working model).
- The prototype is then **tested with real users** to see how well it works and how people actually use it.
- It is **more expensive** than theoretical analysis because it takes **time, planning, and resources** to build and test the system.
- There are **many ways to test**, such as usability testing, user observation, interviews, or surveys but it‚Äôs important to **observe users** while they interact with the design.

## Evaluation (formative)
- Formative evaluation means **testing and improving the design while it‚Äôs still being developed** so that each new version is better than the last.

## Evaluation (summative)
- Summative evaluation means **testing the complete product at the end** to see how well it works, and using the results to **improve the next version**.
